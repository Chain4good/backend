## Project Overview

This project serves as the backend API for a charity application, providing all necessary endpoints for managing users, campaigns, donations, and other related functionalities. It's built using the NestJS framework, ensuring a modular, scalable, and maintainable architecture.

## Features

- **User Management:** User registration, authentication (JWT, OAuth), and profile management.
- **Campaign Management:** Create, read, update, and delete charity campaigns.
- **Donation System:** Process and track donations.
- **KYC (Know Your Customer):** Implementation of KYC features for users.
- **Badge System:** Awarding and managing user badges based on activity.
- **Comment System:** Functionality for users to comment on campaigns or posts.
- **Notification System:** Real-time notifications for various events.
- **Email Services:** Sending transactional emails (e.g., verification, password reset).
- **Image and Audio Uploads:** Handling media uploads for campaigns and user profiles.
- **AI Integration:** (Potentially) AI-powered features for content generation or moderation.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Endpoints for administrative tasks and analytics.

## Technologies Used

- **Framework:** [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) (Node.js)
- **Database:** [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (via Prisma ORM)
- **ORM:** [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- **Authentication:** JWT, Passport.js (Local, Google, Facebook, GitHub strategies)
- **Real-time Communication:** WebSockets (Socket.IO)
- **Caching:** Redis (via Cache Manager)
- **Email:** Nodemailer, Handlebars (for templates)
- **Cloud Storage:** Cloudinary (for image/audio uploads)
- **AI:** Google GenAI, OpenAI
- **Validation:** Class-validator, Class-transformer
- **Dependency Management:** npm
- **Containerization:** Docker

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (or use Docker for the database)

## Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/charity-backend.git
    cd charity-backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your environment variables. A `.env.example` file might be provided as a guide. Key variables typically include:

    - `DATABASE_URL` (for PostgreSQL connection string)
    - `JWT_SECRET`
    - `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`
    - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`
    - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
    - `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID`, `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET`
    - `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
    - `MAILER_EMAIL`, `MAILER_PASSWORD`
    - `GEMINI_API_KEY`
    - `OPENAI_API_KEY`

4.  **Database Setup (using Docker Compose for convenience):**

    You can use Docker Compose to spin up a PostgreSQL and Redis instance:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d postgres redis
    ```

    _Ensure your `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` points to the Dockerized PostgreSQL instance (e.g., `postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/database`)._

5.  **Run Prisma Migrations:**

    Generate Prisma client and apply migrations to your database:

    ```bash
    npm run prisma:generate
    npx prisma migrate dev --name init
    ```

    _(Note: `init` can be replaced with a descriptive name for your initial migration)_

## Running the Application

- **Development Mode (with watch):**

  ```bash
  npm run start:dev
  ```

- **Production Mode:**

  ```bash
  npm run start:prod
  ```

- **Debug Mode:**

  ```bash
  npm run start:debug
  ```

The application will typically run on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your environment variables).

## Running Tests

- **Unit Tests:**

  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```

- **End-to-End Tests:**

  ```bash
  npm run test:e2e
  ```

- **Test Coverage:**

      ```bash

  npm run test:cov

  ```

  ```

- **CI-like Testing (locally):**

  ```bash
  npm run test:ci
  ```

  This runs the same tests that will run in the CI/CD pipeline, including linting, type checking, and tests with coverage.

## CI/CD Pipeline

[![CI/CD Status](https://github.com/your-username/charity-backend/workflows/CI%2FCD%20Pipeline/badge.svg)](https://github.com/your-username/charity-backend/actions)

This project includes a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that ensures code quality and automates deployment.

### Pipeline Overview

The CI/CD pipeline consists of two main jobs:

1. **Test Job** - Runs on every push and pull request
2. **Deploy Job** - Runs only on pushes to main branch (after tests pass)

### Test Job Features

- üß™ **Automated Testing**: Runs full test suite with coverage
- üîç **Code Quality**: ESLint and TypeScript checks
- üìä **Coverage Reports**: Generates and uploads test coverage to Codecov
- üêò **Database Testing**: Uses PostgreSQL service for realistic testing
- üèóÔ∏è **Build Verification**: Ensures the application builds successfully

### Test Job Steps

1. **Environment Setup**

   - Node.js 18 with npm caching
   - PostgreSQL 15 service container
   - Test environment variables

2. **Code Quality Checks**

   - Install dependencies with `npm ci`
   - Generate Prisma client
   - Run database migrations
   - ESLint code linting
   - TypeScript compilation check

3. **Testing**
   - Run full test suite with coverage
   - Upload coverage reports to Codecov

### Deploy Job Features

- üöÄ **Automated Deployment**: Deploys to VPS only after tests pass
- üê≥ **Docker Integration**: Builds and pushes Docker images
- üì¶ **Optimized Builds**: Uses GitHub Actions cache for faster builds
- üîÑ **Rolling Updates**: Zero-downtime deployment with Docker Compose

### Secrets Required

To set up the pipeline, configure these secrets in your GitHub repository:

**Docker Hub:**

- `DOCKER_USERNAME` - Your Docker Hub username
- `DOCKER_TOKEN` - Your Docker Hub access token

**VPS Deployment:**

- `VPS_HOST` - Your VPS IP address or hostname
- `VPS_USERNAME` - SSH username for VPS
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` - SSH private key for VPS access

### Running Tests Locally

To run the same tests that run in CI:

```bash
# Run CI-like tests locally
npm run test:ci

# Or run individual commands
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run test:cov
```

### Pipeline Triggers

- **Push to main**: Runs tests + deployment
- **Pull Request**: Runs tests only
- **Manual trigger**: Available through GitHub Actions UI

### Monitoring

- View pipeline status: GitHub Actions tab
- Coverage reports: [Codecov Dashboard](https://codecov.io/gh/your-username/charity-backend)
- Build artifacts: Available in GitHub Actions runs

## API Documentation

API documentation will be available (e.g., via Swagger/OpenAPI) once the application is running, typically at `http://localhost:3000/api` or a similar path, depending on the configuration.

## Deployment

For deployment, you can build the application and run the production bundle:

```bash
npm run build
node dist/main
```

Consider using Docker for production deployments. A `Dockerfile` is provided in the project root.

To build the Docker image:

```bash
npm run docker:build
```

Refer to the [NestJS Deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more advanced deployment strategies.
